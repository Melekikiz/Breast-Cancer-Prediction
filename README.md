# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction – ML + GUI Application

This project is a complete end-to-end **machine learning application** with a custom-designed **desktop GUI**, developed to predict whether a breast tumor is **malignant** or **benign**. The machine learning model is built and trained from scratch on the well-known **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**, and seamlessly integrated into a user-friendly interface using **CustomTkinter**.

## 🚀 Highlights

- ✅ **Trained-from-scratch ML model** (Logistic Regression with preprocessing & feature selection)
- ✅ **Beautiful GUI** built with `customtkinter` – fully functional and modern
- ✅ **Real medical feature input** with clear labels and data validation
- ✅ **Color-coded prediction output**: Malignant or Benign
- ✅ Ready to run locally with just Python and `pickle` support
